# Welcome to SatPass - Satellite Visibility Calculator!

SatPass is a simple application that calculates satellite pass look angles from any chose location around the world. Simply fill in the fields for a satellite catalog number, the dates you would like to retrieve pass information, and your location's latitude, longitude, and altitude; alternatively, you can select from a list of built-in locations and popular satellites. Once the fields are entered, select "Generate Pass List". After a few seconds, the table at the bottom will fill in with some information about the selected satellite, and the table at the top will populate with all the passes available from the selected location for the given time frame. Select a pass from the table to see detailed second-by-second look angles for the selected pass.

# How does it work?
SatPass uses the [Orekit](https://www.orekit.org/) and [Hipparchus](https://www.hipparchus.org/) libraries for propagation and fast math, respectively. The current propagation model uses the SGP4 model for near earth objects and SDP4 for deep space objects. The TLE (two line element set) data is pulled from [Celestrak](https://celestrak.org/). TLE contains Keplerian elements that are used by the propagation model to generate the look angles.

# Why is my satellite not showing any passes?
If TLE data is not successfully pulled from [Celestrak](https://celestrak.org/), an error will be displayed with more information. [Celestrak](https://celestrak.org/) will block your IP address temporarily if you make around 20 requests per hour. Otherwise, some satellites will not be visible for all locations. Geosynchronous satellites are in an orbit that keeps there relative location static to a certain longitude. A geosynchronous satellite over India will never be visible from Florida unless the satellite performs some maneuvers. Also, some low earth orbit satellites, such as the ISS, will never be visible from certain locations. Visibility is largely dependent on the inclination of the satellite. An inclination of 15 degrees means that the satellite will only orbit within 15 degrees north latitude and 15 degrees south latitude. So some locations further north or south of that latitude will have less or no visibility. In general, lower latitudes are ideal for seeing more satellites. Sun-sychronous satellites (inclination 97-98 degrees) will have about 4 passes per day at any point on earth.

# What's next?
I plan on taking a lot of the functionality from this application into a new application that will have more functionality. Due to time constraints, I wasn't able to create more functionality. The next application will have a database of satellites that only queries [Celestrak](https://celestrak.org/) if the database has not been updated in 12 hours. This query will pull the entire space catalog in raw text so that at most two queries are made to [Celestrak](https://celestrak.org/) per day. This will also speed up the applications propagation significantly, as each time "Generate Pass List" is selected, a query is made to [Celestrak](https://celestrak.org/). I also want to add functionality to see more than one satellite at a time, and a 3D model to show where satellites are, or will be at a given time.

# About me
You may wonder why I made a satellite visibility calculator. Well, I work in the Space/Defense industry in Huntsville (Rocket City), AL and I work with some of the most powerful sensors in the world that contribute to the space catalog. While there are more and more open-source applications that plot orbiting objects (such as [Keep Track](https://www.keeptrack.space/)), most fall short of the kind of information that I and my colleagues may want to see. This kind of information can be used by amateur/hobbyist stargazers to spot and/or photograph some of the larger satellites, such as the ISS. Anyway, I'm a big space nerd and can't wait to use more of what I learn in this degree program to make more space products.
